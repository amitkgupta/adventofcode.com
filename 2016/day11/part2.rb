# There seems to be a pattern. For an initial setup with two generators
# on the first floor and two corresponding microchips on the second
# floor, 11 moves are needed. For every generator-microchip pair added
# to the first floor, an additional 12 moves are needed. Thus, adding
# two more pairs to the first floor in Part 2 implies the answer is
# 12 x 2 greater than the answer for Part 1.

# TODO: prove this pattern

puts 47 + 2 * 12
