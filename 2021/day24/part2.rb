# Following the same reasoning in the comments of Part 1,
# we get the same system of equations relating the input
# digits, but we now want them to be as small as possible
# rather than as large as possible (while each remaining in
# the range 1..9).
#
# For example, with w5 = w4-1, we get w4=2, w5=1. With
# w13 = w2+1, we get w2=1 and w13=2. Ultimately, we get the
# desired input:
#
# 31521119151421

puts 31521119151421
